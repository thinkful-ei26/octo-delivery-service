## Proof of Concept:
What can you get done at the end of today to know that this is going to work for the rest of the week?
- :white_check_mark: Render octopus with game controls
- :white_check_mark: Detect collisions and have feedback in the game
- :construction: Game success & game over scenario

**Tech Personal Goals:**
- Know how to manage state, controls, & collision using the PyGame physics engine
- Use scenes if possible
- Use open-source sprites if possible or create one. Use static images for now.

**Creativity Goals**
- Make sure to tie in Octopus-related themes:
  - 8 lives
  - 8 packages to return
- Produce some images, possibly a sprite sheet

## Game Controls (thus far)
- **ESC** quit game
- **SPACEBAR** shoot ink bullets
- **UP** move octopus up
- **DOWN** move octopus down
- **LEFT** move octopus left
- **RIGHT** move octopus right
