# Notes

## Draw an object:

```python
pygame.draw.rect(win, (red), (x, y, width, height)) # window/canvas, color of object, and (x, y) positions in pixels (width & height) of object 

# win.blit(squid, (screenWidth-40, (screenHeight/2 -60), width, height))
# win.blit(shell, ((screenWidth/2), (screenHeight/2 -60), width, height))
```
